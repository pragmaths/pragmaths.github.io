For any natural number \\(n\\) (in symbols: \\(\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)), \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\): Set of \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). It is usually called \\(n\\)-dimensional real space. The elements of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) are written \\((x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n})\\), where each \\(x_{i}\\) is a real number. Example: For \\(n=2\\), the elements of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) are written \\((x_{1},x_{2})\\) and usually visualized on a Cartesian plane. [img] 1.2 About functions A function describes the relation between two sets. T 1.3 About norms (In the context of Statistical Learning) A norm is a function from the \\(n\\)-dimensional real space to the non-negative real numbers, in symbols: \\[\\ell: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq0}\\] This function is intrinsically related to the concept of distance. It is usually denoted by enclosing within double vertical lines, if \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) then the norm of \\(x\\) is represented by: \\(||x||\\). 1.4 Linear Regression "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
